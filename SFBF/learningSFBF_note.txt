2.counting bloomfilter
A fatal weakness of SFBF is that, this variant of BF cannot support delete operation. Setting the “1”s to “0”s of an item may result in the deletion of wrong items, due to the existence of hash conflicts. This issue should be discussed.


3.genreate k indepedence matric
I wonder how to keep the independence between the k base matrices so as to deduce the k independent hash functions. Moreover, the paper has not evaluated or discussed the storage overhead of maintaining these matrices.

YouTube Traces From the Campus Network

youtube_traces.tgz contains two different sets of traces:

- youtube.parsed.*.dat
  These trace files contain information about client requests for YouTube
  video clips. Each line in a file represents such a request and is of the 
  following format:
  
  #Timestamp	    #YouTube server IP #Client IP    #Request #Video ID   #Content server IP
                     (anonymized)       (anonymized)

#Video ID和#Content server IP连在一起，hash成一个32位的整数
