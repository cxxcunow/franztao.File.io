%\del{In this paper, we have proved the Min-Min  SRLG-Disjoint routing problem is NP-complete.}
In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the Min-Min  SRLG-Disjoint routing problem in the presence of the trap problem. To reduce the complexity of searching for the alternative pair, we propose a divide-and-conquer solution to partition the original Min-Min SRLG-Disjoint routing problem into multiple sub-problems based on a SRLG conflicting link set derived from the AP path encountering the trap problem. Our algorithm takes advantage of existing AP search results and parallel executions for significantly faster path finding.
We have conducted extensive simulations  using the topology trace  on a multi-core CPU platform. The simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm can outperform other approaches with higher routing performance while at a much higher search speed.
