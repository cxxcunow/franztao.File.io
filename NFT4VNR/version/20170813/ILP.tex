\section{requesting survival virtual network using integer linear programming}
\label{sec:SeVN_ILP}
The one of contributions of this paper is the modelization of specific node fault tolerant problem as an optimization. The general technique used to solve this problem is a combined algorithm consisting of enumeration and Ullmann Algorithm\cite{ullmann1976algorithm}, which is proposed as a  algorithm of exponential complexity which is brute force method briefly. More precisely, we propose an Integer Program\cite{schrijver1998theory} model of this problem. In the following, We briefly explain how to solve a problem using Integer Program.

\subsection{Modeling the SeVN problem}
In this section, we formulate the problems discussed in the previous sections with Integer Program method. Though we have proved that these problems are NP-complete, as we will demonstrate later, the IP formulation of the problem provides a very viable tool for solving it, for most real-world virtual network request which typically have less than a few hundred nodes and edges. Throughout this section, we will focus exclusively on the survival embedded virtual network request [$G(V,E,S),B(V,S))$], we assume that $G$ is simple undirected service label graph.
%the term graph represents a loop undirected non multidigraph. As a consequence, an edge e originating from i and targeting to j and can be denoted ij without any ambiguity.

%In order to model the problem as an ILP, we use binary variables, i.e. C=$\{0,1\}^n$
%transform the graph for reduce the constrain condition of service function.\ref{fig:ILP_transfromed_graph},\ref{fig:ILP_inserted_augmented_transformed_graph}.

To begin with, we introduce some necessary notation:

$C^o$: $[c_{u}]_{|V|+|B|}$, node computation matrix of the SNFT graph $G^o$. where

${c^o_{u}}=\left\{ \begin{array}{l}x\ if\ node\ u\ have\ node computation\ x\\
0\ otherwise
\end{array} \right.$.

$C$: $[c_{u}]_{|V|}$, node computation matrix of the arbitrary graph $G$. where

${c_{u}}=\left\{ \begin{array}{l}x\ if\ node\ u\ have\ node computation\ x\\
0\ otherwise
\end{array} \right.$.

$B^o$: $[b^o_{u,v}]_{(|V|+|B|)\times (|V|+|B|)}$, the edge's bandwith matrix of graph $G^o$. where

${b^o_{u,v}}=\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
x\ if\ edge\ e\ originates\ from\ u\ to\ v\ and\ correspongding bandwith's cost\\
0\ otherwise
\end{array} \right.$ \\

$B$: $[b_{u,v}]_{|V|\times |V|}$, the edge's bandwith matrix of arbitrary graph $G$. Where

${b_{u,v}}=\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
1\ if\ edge\ e\ originates\ from\ u\ to\ v\ and\ correspongding bandwith's cost\\
0\ otherwise
\end{array} \right.$ \\

%matrix of service functions set corresponding to node
$T^{l}$: $[t^l_{u,v}]_{|V|\times (|V|+|B|)}$, The $l$-th node permutation matrix against $l$-th node failed. Where

${t^l_{u,v}}=\left\{ \begin{array}{l}1\ if\ node\ u\ transformed\ to\ node\ v\\
0\ otherwise
\end{array} \right.$.

$S^o$: $[s_{u,v}]_{(|V|+|B|)\times |S|}$, incidence matrix of services of the SNFT graph $G^o$. where

${s^o_{u,v}}=\left\{ \begin{array}{l}1\ if\ node\ u\ have\ serivice\ v\\
0\ otherwise
\end{array} \right.$.

$S$: $[s_{u,v}]_{|V|\times |S|}$, incidence matrix of services of the arbitrary graph $G$. where

${s_{u,v}}=\left\{ \begin{array}{l}1\ if\ node\ u\ have\ serivice\ v\\
0\ otherwise
\end{array} \right.$.

$A$:$[a_i]_{|B|}$, whether the i-th backup nodes is used or not. where

${A_i}=\left\{ \begin{array}{l}1\ if\ node\ i\ is\ used\\
0\ otherwise
\end{array} \right.$.

The problem of requesting 1-service node fault tolerant graph [$G(V,E,S),B(V,S))$] can be formulated as the following Integer Programming problem:
\begin{center}
\begin{align}
\label{equ:ILPC10} T^l*C^o&\geq C\\
\label{equ:ILPC1} T^l*(T^l* B^o)^{'}&\geq B\\
\label{equ:ILPC7} B_{u,v}&\leq B^o_{u,v}(1\leq u\leq n,1\leq v\leq n)\\
\label{equ:ILPC2} \sum_{1\leq v\leq (n+b)}T^l_{i,v}&= 1 (1\leq i\leq n)\\
\label{equ:ILPC3} \sum_{1\leq u\leq n}T^l_{u,j}&\leq 1 (1\leq j\leq (n+b))  \\
\label{equ:ILPC4} \sum_{1\leq u\leq n,1\leq v\leq (n+b)}T^l_{u,v}&=n \\
\label{equ:ILPC5}  T^k_{u,k}&=0 (1\leq u\leq n)\\
\label{equ:ILPC8} T^l*S^o &\geq S\\
\label{equ:ILPC9} T^l_{u,(n+i)} &\leq A_i(1\leq u\leq n,1\leq i\leq b)\\
\end{align}
\end{center}


\begin{itemize}
\item Constraint(\ref{equ:ILPC10}) guarantees that computation resource of every nodes of augment graph $G^o$ larger than computation resource of every nodes of former graph $G$ when the l-th critical node of graph $G^o$ failed, we could confirm graph $G$ which is subgraph isomorphism of augment graph $G^o$. we represent the mapping relation as permutation matrix in view of Ullman\cite{ullmann1976algorithm}

\item Constraint(\ref{equ:ILPC1}) bandwith resource of every edges of augment graph $G^o$ larger than bandwith resource of every edges of former graph $G$ when the l-th critical node of graph $G^o$ failed.

\item Constraint(\ref{equ:ILPC7}) guarantees that augment graph $G^o$ must be the augmented graph of previous graph $G$.
\item Constraint(\ref{equ:ILPC2},\ref{equ:ILPC3},\ref{equ:ILPC4},\ref{equ:ILPC5}) implies that operation of the transform matrix of mapping relation is appropriate and correct format in respect with one node failure.
\item Constraint(\ref{equ:ILPC8}) guarantees that  service types of every nodes of augment graph $G^o$ contain service types of every nodes of former graph $G$ when the l-th critical node of graph $G^o$ failed

\subsection{Objective Function and Approximation}
We seek to minimize the amount of resource used for a SeVN request. The object function of the adapted IP is then
\begin{align}
min: \alpha \sum_{1\leq i\leq b}A_i+ & \notag \\
\beta \times(\sum_{1\leq u\leq (n+b)}C^o_{u,v}- & \sum_{1\leq u\leq n}C_{u}) + \notag \\
\gamma \times(\sum_{1\leq u\leq (n+b),1\leq v\leq (n+b)}B^o_{u,v}- & \sum_{1\leq u\leq n,1\leq v\leq n}B_{u,v})
\end{align}
where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are weight about add new node , node's computation and link's bandwith, respectively. To achieve minimize the amount of nodes, $\alpha\gg\beta,\alpha\gg\gamma$, respectively, $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=1$. According to\cite{armbrust2009above,yu2010survivable} the relative cost of computing and bandwidth $\theta=\RelativeCostbetweenComputingBandwidth$, which means $\beta/\gamma=\theta=\RelativeCostbetweenComputingBandwidth$.

The presence of the boolean variables let the integer program of SeVN into a NP-Hard problem. An alterative is to relax the boolean variables to real-value variables between 0 and 1, obtain an approximate virtual node transformation matrix, then rounding decimal value into one or zero and judge the node transformation matrix is logically legal.
