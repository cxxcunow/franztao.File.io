\section{HeuristicAlgorithms}
However, as a matter of fact, computing the minimum additional
resources needed to convert one attributed graph to
another (hereafter called graph alignment problem, GAP) is an
NP-complete problem which could be reduced from the Graph
Edit Distance problem [26]. Therefore, we relax some constraints
and propose two heuristic algorithms. In detail, we first
decompose a graph to a multiset of star structures which retains
certain structural information of the original graph. Then, the
graph alignment cost could be approximated by the matching
cost between two graphs based on their star representations.
This approach is elaborated as follows.
