\subsection{Time Complexity}
The formulation of SeVN request problem indicates that this problem is a binary quadratically programming problem in optimization field , and the essence of SeVN problem solution is a series of permutation matrix  which determine the migration reassigning approach after each node failure. There are all $|V|$ nodes of virtual network failed, the time complexity of iteration in every nodes is $O[|V|*|S|*\prod_{i=1}^{|S|}c^i]$. Thus, its overall computation complexity is $O[|V|*|S|*|V|*\prod_{i=1}^{|S|}c^i]$, where $|V|$ is number of failure node.
