\subsection{Time Complexity}
The formulation of SeVN request problem indicates that this problem is a Binary Quadratically Programing problem in optimization field , and the essence of this problem solution is a series of permutation matrix  which determine the migration reassigning approach after each node failure. There are all n nodes of virtual network failed, the time complexity of iteration in every nodes is $O[m*n*\prod_{i=1}^{m}C^i]$. Thus, its overall computation complexity is $O[n*m*n*\prod_{i=1}^{m}C^i]$, where n is number of failure node.
