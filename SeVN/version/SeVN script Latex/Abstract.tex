\begin{abstract}
Network virtualization has been recognized as a promising solution to enable the rapid deployment of customized services by building multiple Virtual Networks (VNs) on a shared substrate network. Whereas various VN embedding schemes have been proposed to allocate substrate resources to VN requests, little work has been done to provide backup mechanisms in case of substrate network failures. In a virtualized infrastructure where physical resources are shared, a single physical server failure will terminate several virtual serves and crippling the virtual infrastructures which contained those virtual servers. To guarantee some level of survivability, each virtual infrastructure, at instantiation, should be augmented with backup virtual nodes and links. Provisioning survivability to requested embeded virtual network(VN) which is embedded in substrate networks (SN) in a resource efficient way is important. we investigate the problem of backup network provision for embedded VN embedding and propose one star graph decomposition and dynamic programming for node mapping, in order to provide the same degree of protection against a single node failure with less substrate resources. Simulation experiments show that we proposed scheme make better high acceptance ratio and utilization of substrate resources than other backup schemes.
