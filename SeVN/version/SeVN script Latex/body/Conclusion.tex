\subsection{Conclusion}
In this paper, We propose an efficient algorithm $\MyAlgorithmMethodAbrreviation$ to efficiently solve allocating augmented resources (starting new physical node, link bandwidth or node computation) of the $\MyProblemAbrreviation$  problem in a substrate network for embedded virtual network with survivability guarantees request, which is guaranteed through redundant nodes and links. The resource allocation approach regards whether the redundant nodes are passive or reactive so long as ample resources are available when recovering from failures.

Since a physical infrastructure(substrate network) hosts multiple VNs, it is more resource efficient to share redundant nodes between VN. To reduce the allocated resource for survivability guarantees. We introduced a heuristic method to share these redundancies for both independent and cascading types of failures and do the best to minimum allocated resource based on Star-Constructer decomposition and dynamic programming.

Our algorithm take a novel allocate resource method for reducing new-booting hosts and minimizing resource with limited process time, in addition, Integer Program can not calculate out the optimal solution even the scale of problem is relatively small. The simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm have significant impact in conserving resources, achieving high acceptance rates ,high resource utilization and low number of active node.
