\subsection{Time Complexity}
In conclusion, the formulation indicates that this problem is a BQP problem and the solution of this problem is a series of permutation matrix  which determine the migration reassigning approach after each node failure. Thus, its computation complexity is $O[n*(n+b)*n*\prod_{i=1}^{n+b}C^i]$, where n is number of failure node.
