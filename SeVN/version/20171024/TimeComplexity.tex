\subsection{Time Complexity}
In conclusion, the formulation indicates that this problem is a BQP problem and the solution of this problem is a series of permutation matrix  which determine the migration reassigning approach after each node failure. Thus, its computation complexity is  , where N is the computation
complexity for one node failure.
