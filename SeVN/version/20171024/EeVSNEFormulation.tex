\section{EeVSN Formulation}
After designing an EVN, in this section, we also formulate
its embedding problem as an MILP fitting for both FD-EVN
and FI-EVN embedding, since the difference between them in
embedding approach could be reconciled by a general resources
sharing constraint. More details would be elaborated in the following
part.

with respect to the node embedding, we
have the assumption that all the virtual nodes in EVN should be
mapped on physically isolated substrate nodes.

different node failure scenarios.
Thus, rather than solving the link embedding problem based
on the multi-commodity flow LP, we need consider the resource
sharing issues, which is computational intractable. As a result,
heuristic algorithms with acceptable computation complexity.
