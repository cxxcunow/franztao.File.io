As virtualization is becoming a promising way to support various emerging application. In a virtualized infrastructure where physical resources are shared, a single physical server failure will terminate several virtual serves and crippling the virtual infrastructures which contained those virtual servers. To guarantee some level of reliability, each virtual infrastructure, at instantiation, should be augmented with backup virtual nodes and links. provisioning survivability to requested embeded virtual network(VN) which is embedded in substrate networks (SN) in a resource efficient way is important. In this paper, First, we consider the failure dependent protection (FDP) in which each primary facility node would have a different backup facility node, as opposed to the Failure Independent Protection (FIP) which has been studied before, in order to provide the same degree of protection against a single node failure with less substrate resources. Secondly, we protect the embeded VN with additional computing and communication resources and design the Survivable eVN (or EeVN) after embedding it to the substrate in order to further reduce the amount of substrate resources needed to survive a single facility node failure.
