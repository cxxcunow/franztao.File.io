\subsection{Conclusion}
We considered the problem of efficiently allocating resources in a substrate network for embedded virtual network with reliability guarantees, which is
guaranteed through redundant nodes and links. The resource allocation approach disregards whether the redundant nodes are passive or hot standbys so long as ample resources are available when recovering from failures. Since a physical infrastructure(substrate network) hosts multiple VN, it is
more resource efficient to share redundant nodes between VN. We introduced a heuristics to share these redundancies for both independent and cascading types
of failures. The physical footprint of redundant links can be reduced as well, by considering the maximum over all failure scenarios while allocating resources with a linear program adapted from the dynamic programing problem. Both mechanisms have significant impact in conserving resources and improving VInf acceptance rates.
