\subsection{Subgraph Isomorphism Proof}
Denote $G^*$ as augment virtual network topological structure , denote $G$ former virtual network topological structure. Based on mathematical induction, we proof that $G$ is subgraph isomorphism of $G^*-v_i (v_i\in $G$)$. First describe graph isomorphism theorem as below.
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item when every a failure node of $v_i$, every failure node is guaranteed to be mapped another normal node.
%  \item suppose
%  \item n+1
%\end{enumerate}
\begin{theorem}
 In graph theory, an isomorphism of graphs $G$ and $H$ is a bijection function $f:V(G)\rightarrow V(H)$ between the vertex sets of G and H such that any two vertices u and v of $G$ are adjacent in $G$ if and only if $f(u)$ and $f(v)$ are adjacent in $H$. If an isomorphism exists between two graphs, then the graphs are called isomorphic and denoted as $G\simeq H$.
\end{theorem} 

Suppose certain one graph $G^o$ is subgraph of $G^*$. Based the mapping relationship from Sec.\ref{sub:SeVNDesignFormulation}, there must be one to one mapping between graph $G$ and graph $G^o$. The some node $v_i$ of graph $G$ if and only if map a node $v_i^o$ of graph $G^o$. According to schema of our heuristic algorithm, there must exist one edge or create one edge ($v^o_iv^o_j$) for lack situation between node $v^o_i$ and node $v^o_j$ , which is corresponding to edge $v^o_iv^o_j$ of graph $G$. Consequently, there is a bijection function that one to one map every edge $e$ of graph $G$ to edge $e^o$ of graph $G^o$, $G$ is isomorphic to graph $G^o$, graph $G^o$ is subgraph of $G^*$, $G$ is subgraph isomorphism of graph $G^*$
