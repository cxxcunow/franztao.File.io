\subsection{Subgraph Isomorphism Proof}
Denote $G^*$ as augment virtual network topological structure , denote $G$ former virtual network topological structure. Based on mathematical induction, we proof that $G$ is subgraph isomorphism of $G^*-v_i (v_i\in $G$)$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item when every a failure node of $v_i$, every failure node is guaranteed to be mapped another normal node.
  \item suppose
  \item n+1
\end{enumerate}
